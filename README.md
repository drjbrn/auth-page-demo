# auth-page-demo

This project is my first attempt at using React and is a demo version of a registration and login system developed with create-react-app

The project consists of four pages: 
- home page, 
- registration page consisting of two steps,
- login page,
- and 404 error page.

User data is encrypted and stored in localStorage during registration, and only this data can be used for login.

The following technologies are used for the effective implementation of the project:
- React Router (for seamless navigation between pages)
- react-secure-storage (for secure storage of user data in localStorage)
